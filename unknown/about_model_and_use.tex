In the creation of this model, a focus on disk galaxies has been profitable due to their high gas fraction and the useful property that it is relatively easy \citep{schaye2004} to conflate surface densities and 3D densities.
This allows an effective equation of state $p \propto \rho^{\gamma_{eff}}$ to be connected with the abundant observations of disk galaxies as well as simulations.
However, this does not mean that the equation of state is only applicable to isolated disk galaxies; it is instead that these idealised systems are used to study how the gas dynamics depend on large-scale properties such as star formation rate.
The same gas, with the same dynamics, resides elsewhere in the Universe, regardless of its local environment.
Once the behaviour of the gas in a disk galaxy is understood, the model can be immediately extended to a cosmological scale due to this property.
