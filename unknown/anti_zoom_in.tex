A productive tool in modern-day cosmological research are `zoom-in' simulations, where a portion of a large scale simulation is ran at a considerably higher resolution after the fact.
The model presented in this work is almost an `anti-zoom-in' model, due to the use of small-scale simulations from \citet{martizzi2015} to calibrate the properties of resolution elements in a larger-scale simulation through macroscopic properties.
It can be argued that this is a more convergent way of performing this kind of research; if a small-scale simulation was ran based on the macroscopic parameters within the resolution elements, it should automatically fit with the large-scale one.

This is, by no means, a suggestion that this model is resolution-independent.
It is quite clear that this model is only appropriate for use on length scales where the difference between the process of star formation and supernovae is negligible, <CALCULATE THIS>.
