The custom \sv module created for this project is open source and available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JBorrow/SurVis}}.
It is essentially a histogramming module that accepts Gadget data and outputs some movies and plots.
The \sv library makes extensive use of the Matplotlib and Numpy scientific computing libraries \citep{hunter_matplotlib:_2007, walt_numpy_2011}

It was created to be extensible; all of the plots generated in the thesis use this module as a backend (you can find the specific plot generation scripts in the project repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JBorrow/MPhysThesis}}).
