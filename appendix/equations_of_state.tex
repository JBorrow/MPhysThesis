The simulation software GADGET-2 ships with two possible equations of state,
\begin{itemize}
\item isothermal, with $\gamma_{eff} = 1$,
\item default, ideal gas, with $\gamma_{eff} = 5/3$.
\end{itemize}
The effective equation of state uncovered in this work differs substaitonally from both of these, it has both a constant entropy $S$ (where $p = S\rho_g^{\gamma_{eff}}$), and a different value of $\gamma_{eff} = 5/4$.

To implement a custom equation of state, the entropy of the SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) particles must be modified.
If one naievely attempts to interact with the pressure of the gas directly, this leads to the temperature of the particles being modified spuriously/
The entropy of each particle ({\tt SphP.Entropy}) is set to
$$
4.5\left(\frac{f}{F}\right)^{{3/2}} G^{{3/4}} P_{fin}^{{1/2}} \fgas^{-1}
$$
with $\fgas$ being treated as a global parameter in this case.
The entropy differential ({\tt SphP.DtEntropy}) is set to 0, to ensure the temperature of the gas remains constant.
This modification can be found in the commit {\tt b5141ea} of InterstellarGadget.
