\section*{Acknowledgements}

This author would like to thank Prof. Richard Bower for his advice, helpful discussions, and support over the past four years; Dr. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay for sharing some of his extremely in-depth knowledge of the Gadget-2 code with me; and Drs. Henk Slim and Lydia Heck for their help in getting the simulations running on the Hamilton and COSMA clusters respectively. I must also extend my thanks to my partner and family for their support over the past four years.
