\section{Acknowledgements}

This author would like to thank Prof. Richard Bower for his advice, helpful discussions, and support over the past four years; Dr. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay for sharing some of his extremely in-depth knowledge of the Gadget-2 code with me; and Dr. Till Sawala for getting me into the field many years ago. I must also extend my thanks to my partner and family for their emotional support over the past four years.
