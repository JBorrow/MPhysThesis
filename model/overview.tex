In the model proposed below, the weight of the disk galaxy is supported by the turbulence injected by supernoave.
This links density and star formation together; a higher gas density leads to leads to more star formation and hence a higher supernovae rate.
This higher supernova rate injects more turbulence into the system (i.e. a higher pressure), expanding the gas and decreasing the pressure.
Under an equilibrium situation, there can be a relation formed between the surface star formation rate and surface gas density.

Once this star formation relation (which is similar to the Kennicutt-Schmidt law described above) has been formulated, it can be combined with calibration simulations provided by \citet{martizzi_supernova_2015} that give the relation between dispersion injected from supernovae and surface gas density to produce an effective equation of state, which is found to have a polytropic index of $\gamma_eff = 5/4$.
