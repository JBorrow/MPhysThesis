Towards a Physical Model of the Interstellar Medium
===================================================

Can Supernovae Stabalise a Galaxy?
----------------------------------

This was a 4th Year project at Durham University, with Prof. Richard Bower as the supervisor.

The thesis is designed to be 'executable' -- one should only have to run
```
./compile.sh --figs
```
to generate the figures and produce the full thesis.

It is also designed to be a highly modular tex document, so if you are wondering how to structure a thesis this should hopefully be a useful example for you.

It uses the ```SurVis``` module that is also available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/JBorrow/SurVis).
