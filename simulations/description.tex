All simulations were ran with the same fixed NFW profile with the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $c = 20.1$
    \item $R = 16.1$ kpc
    \item $M_{H} = 1.53 \times 10^{12}$ $\msun$,
\end{itemize}
where $c$ is the concentration parameter such that
$$
    M_{H} = 4\pi \rho_{DM} R^3 \left[ \ln (1 + c) - \frac{c}{1+c} \right]~,
$$
is the mass of the halo with $R$ the scale radius.
The density of the halo as a function of radius is 
\begin{equation}
    \rho(r) = \frac{\rho_{DM}}{\frac{r}{R} \left( 1 + \frac{r}{R} \right)^2}~,
    \label{eqn:nfw}
\end{equation}
the NFW profile.

The runs also have a fixed total mass in the disk, of $8\times10^{10} \msun$ to reproduce approximately the mass of the Milky Way.
The disks are initialised with an exponential profile, with scale radius $3$ kpc for both stellar and gaseous material.
The scale height of the gas is initialised to be 2 kpc, with the stellar component initially having a scale height of 0.3 kpc.

\subsection{Resolution Dependence}

The simulations are shown after $\approx 2$ Gyr of evolution in Figure \ref{fig:sdbig}. At first glance, the simulations appear to be approximately resolution-independent, relaxing to a similar disk realtively quickly.

Of particlar interest is the scale height of the disk between the {\tt custom\_lowres}, {\tt custom}, and {\tt custom\_highres} runs.

Note that the colourmap is cut off below $0.1 \msun \pc^{-2}$ and above $1000 \msun \pc^{-2}$ for clarity. Spiral structure has formed in the {\tt custom} runs with density waves permeating the whole galaxy, whereas the {\tt default} runs have remained relatively uniform.}
