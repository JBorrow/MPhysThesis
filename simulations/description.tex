All simulations were ran with the same fixed NFW profile with the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $c = 20.1$
    \item $R = 16.1$ kpc
    \item $M_{H} = 1.53 \times 10^{12}$ $\msun$,
\end{itemize}
where $c$ is the concentration parameter such that
$$
    M_{H} = 4\pi \rho_{DM} R^3 \left[ \ln (1 + c) - \frac{c}{1+c} \right]~,
$$
is the mass of the halo with $R$ the scale radius.
The density of the halo as a function of radius is 
\begin{equation}
    \rho(r) = \frac{\rho_{DM}}{\frac{r}{R} \left( 1 + \frac{r}{R} \right)^2}~,
    \label{eqn:nfw}
\end{equation}
the NFW profile.

The runs also have a fixed total mass in the disk, of $8\times10^{10} \msun$ to reproduce approximately the mass of the Milky Way.
The disks are initialised with an exponential profile, with scale radius $3$ kpc for both stellar and gaseous material.
The scale height of the gas is initialised to be 2 kpc, with the stellar component initially having a scale height of 0.3 kpc.

\subsection{Resolution Dependence}

The simulations are shown after $\approx 2$ Gyr of evolution in Figure \ref{fig:sdbig}. At first glance, the simulations appear to be approximately resolution-independent, relaxing to a similar disk realtively quickly.

Of particlar interest is the scale height of the disk between the {\tt custom\_lowres}, {\tt custom}, and {\tt custom\_highres} runs.
These are calculated by fitting an exponential profile,

and the results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:vheighthist}.

    \caption{The vertical distribution of the particles in the disk (for {\tt custom}, {\tt custom\_highres} and {\tt custom\_lowres}) after $\approx 2$ Gyr of evolution from the initial conditions. In blue and orange, the gas histogram and fit are shown, with the same for the star particles being shown in green and red. The {\tt custom\_lowres} is shown with bins ten times as wide as to normalise the overall contents of the histogram. It appears that the scale height of the gas disk is determined by the chosen softening length, as the {\tt custom\_highres} run has a considerable build up of particles within the very center of the disk. Normally, the disk is spread vertically by the ejection from supernovae explosions, and as these are not modelled in a local way in the {\tt custom} model a high degree of clumping is shown.}
