\begin{abstract}
The interstellar medium (ISM) of disk galaxies is a complex and critical subject, however physically motivated models have proved elusive due to the hierarchical structure of the ISM. A simple model for the interstellar medium is presented that balances the weight of a galactic disk with the internal pressures created from star formation and the eventual supernovae of high mass stars. This is achieved by extracting macroscopic parameters from calibration simulations with $\approx$ 1 pc resolution. For such a simple model, it shows a high level of convergence with previous results. The model is tested in simulations of isolated disk galaxies using a modified version of the GADGET-2 SPH code.
