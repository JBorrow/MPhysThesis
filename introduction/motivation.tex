The formation and evolution of galaxies is a central topic in modern astrophysics, and is often studied through the use of numerical simulations.
Increasingly, these simulations utilise a full hydrodynamical code \citep{schaye_eagle_2014,vogelsberger_introducing_2014} rather than the more traditional semi-analytical approach whereby galaxy populations are fit to a dark matter only simulation \citep{baugh_primer_2006, bower2006}.
As such, the understanding of the detailed properties of gas within galaxies and their application to simulations is now a key area of research
In this work, a physically motivated model of the gas dynamics and star formation in a disk galaxy that can be applied to hydrodynamical simulation is presented, along with tests using a modified version of the GADGET-2 simulation code \citep{springel_cosmological_2003}.
