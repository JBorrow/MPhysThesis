The equation of state $p \propto \rho^{4/3}$ was chosen in the EAGLE simulations \citep{schaye2015} due to the useful property that this value of $\gamma_{eff} = 4/3$ ensures the jeans mass is independent of density.
This choice ensures that the jeans mass is always resolved and ensures that spurious clumping (a simulaiton artifact) does not occur, however it is not directly physically motivated.
It turns out that this equation of state is also enough to produce stable galaxies when normalized to $T = 8\times 10^3$ K at $n_H = 10^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$ on the resolution scales considered in EAGLE (approximately 700 pc).
It would be useful to produce an equation of state that has simular features to this but also has a solid physical underpinning.

Work over the past three decades has shown that a fruitful avenue of approach is to consider the situation in which the weight of a galaxy disk is supported by the pressure from star formation processes such as the turbulent pressure injected by supernoave. 
This has been used to study... <!HHH#HEHH!>
This model requires calibration; in particular the interaction of two supernoavae is an important consideration and is not well studied observationally.
To solve this problem, small-scale simulations with a resolution of around 1 pc \citep{martizzi2015} are used.
These models include far more Physics than is resolvable in a cosmological-scale simulation and so are used to extract macroscopic parameters such as the efficiency of supernovae, their turbulence injection, and <> as well as their dependence on local properties like the gas fraction $f_gas = \sg/\Sigma$.
In this work, the simulations of \citet{martizzi2015} are used, and in particular the calibrations of
