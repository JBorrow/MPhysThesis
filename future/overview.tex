It is clear that the model presented above is not perfect; this is expected as it is a simple, first step towards creating a zoom-out subgrid model for gas.
It presents a new way of adding pressure sources to simulations; previously simulators have focused on adding in new external pressure sources, such as stochastic supernovae, AGN feedback, and radiative transfer from stars.
There is so much more to be learned from building a model with its basis in theory, and hopefully these two approaches can eventually converge to the same results.
Baryonic physics is hugely important for the evolution and dynamics of galaxies \citep{vogelsberger_introducing_2014, schaye_eagle_2015}, and the more tools that are available to study its influence the more convincing these results will become.

More study is required to perfect this model, and moving forward this author suggests the following avenues for future research:
