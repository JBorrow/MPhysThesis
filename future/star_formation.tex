A star-formation prescription, such as the one suggested in \citet{tasker_simulating_2006}, is required to produce physical results in the study of this model.
It is clear that, in particular, the high gas fraction ($\fgas$) galaxies studied in the {\tt custom\_highgas} and {\tt default\_highgas} runs would have benefited significantly from the ability to form actual stars and reduce their gas fraction (and hence, in the {\tt custom\_higas} model, produce a higher level of pressure support).

A model of this kind would also require that the gas fraction is measured locally, rather than globally, and this would require extra modifications to the SPH code.
