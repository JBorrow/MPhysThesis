This work, like many similar others in the astrophysical community, lacks mathematical formalism.
The Mori-Zwanzig formalism \citep{ zwanzig_memory_1961, zwanzig_nonequilibrium_2001} is appropriate for the creation of a subgrid model.
In short, the formalism makes it possible to separate fast- and slow-varying variables such that the fast-varying variables can be encapsulated in a subgrid model.
A useful review of the Mori-Zwanzig formalism is available in \citet{xing_mori-zwanzig_2009}.
This work is guilty of using the more ad-hoc method of guessing which variables change quickly and which change slowly over the disk.
Whilst this is a quick way to test models and hypotheses, it is not as robust as using the full mathematical formalism described above.
