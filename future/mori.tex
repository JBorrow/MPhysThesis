This work, like many similar others in the astrophysical community, lacks mathematical formalism.
A formalism does exist in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism \citep{zwanzig_nonequilibrium_2001, zwanzig_memory_1961}, for creating subgrid models.
In short, the formalism makes it possible to separate fast- and slow-varying variables such that the fast-varying variables can be encapsulated in a subgrid model.
A useful review of the Mori-Zwanzig formalism is available in \citet{xing_mori-zwanzig_2009}.
This work is guilty of using the more ad-hoc method of guessing which variables change quickly and which change slowly over the disk.
Whilst this is a profitable, and quick, way to do research, it is not as robust as using the full mathematical formalism described above.
