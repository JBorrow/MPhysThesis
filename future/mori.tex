This work, like many similar others in the astrophysical community, lacks mathematical formalism.
A formalism does exist, created by \citet{moriz_zwanzig}, for creating subgrid models.
As a brief overview
< BRIEF OVERVIEW OF MORI ZWANZIG >
This work is guilty of using the more ad-hoc method of guessing which variables change quickly and which change slowly over the disk.
Whilst this is a profitable, and quick, way to do research, it is not as robust as using the full mathematical formalism described above.
