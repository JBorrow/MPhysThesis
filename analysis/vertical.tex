The work of \citet{schaye2001} was used extensively in the derivations for the equation of state in \S \ref{sec:eos}, notably that
$$
    \sg = L_J \rho_g~,
$$
that the surface density of the gas is equal to the Jeans length multiplied by the 3D density.
Whether this is reproduced accurately from the numerical simulations is a key factor in determining whether such an approach is valid; thankfully it can be parameterized fairly easily.
It is easy to measure the height of the disk by fitting an exponential profile, with
$$
    \rho(z) \propto \mathrm{sech}^2\left(z/Z\right)~,
$$
with $Z$ the veritcal scale height.
The argument in \citet{schaye2001} is that $Z \approx L_J$ locally.
Here, both are measured at many points on the disk and are parametrised through the mean $\bar{Z}$ and standard deviation $s_Z$ (to avoid confusion with the velocity dispersions, $\sigma$, used extensively in this work).
The results for the various runs are presented in Table \ref{tab:scaleheight} and Figure \ref{fig:scaleheight}.
