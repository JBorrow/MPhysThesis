        \caption{The Toomre $Q$ of of all of the runs presented in Table \ref{tab:sims} after $\approx 2$ Gyr of evolution. Of particular note is the spiral structure in {\tt custom} and the similarity between the {\tt lowres} runs and their higher resolution counterparts. The {\tt custom} model has produced a galaxy which is marginally stable ($Q\approx 1$) in accordance with \citet{hopkins_stellar_2012}.}
