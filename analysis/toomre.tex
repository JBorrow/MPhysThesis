        \caption{The Toomre $Q$ of of all of the runs from Table \ref{tab:sims} is shown after $\approx 2$ Gyr of evolution, with the ccolour encoding $Q_{gas}$ being capped at $Q=2$ to ensure clarity. The {\tt custom} model shows clear spiral structure and is marginally stable in accordance with the work of \citet{hopkins_stellar_2012}.}
