The goal of this review is to make the principles behind the hierarchical paradigm accessible to a wide audience by providing a pedagogical introduction to modern theories of galaxy formation. I outline the ingredients of the powerful approach called semi-analytical modelling and contrast this method with numerical simulations of the gas dynamics of baryons. Semi-analytical models have enjoyed many successes, but it is the observations which the models struggle to match which mark out areas where future progress is most likely to be made; these are also reviewed.},

	abstract = {Star formation rates in the centers of disk galaxies often vastly exceed those at larger radii, whether measured by the surface density of star formation Σ SFR , by the star formation rate per unit gas mass, Σ SFR /Σ, or even by total output. In this paper, we investigate the idea that central starbursts are self-regulated systems in which the momentum flux injected to the interstellar medium (ISM) by star formation balances the gravitational force confining the ISM gas in the disk. For most starbursts, supernovae are the largest contributor to the momentum flux, and turbulence provides the main pressure support for the predominantly molecular ISM. If the momentum feedback per stellar mass formed is p * / m * 3000 km s –1 , the predicted star formation rate is Σ SFR 2π G Σ 2 m * / p * 0.1 M ☉ kpc –2 yr –1 (Σ/100 M ☉ pc –2 ) 2 in regions where gas dominates the vertical gravity. We compare this prediction with numerical simulations of vertically resolved disks that model star formation including feedback, finding good agreement for gas surface densities in the range Σ 10 2 -10 3 M ☉ pc –2 . We also compare to a compilation of star formation rates and gas contents from local and high-redshift galaxies (both mergers and normal galaxies), finding good agreement provided that the conversion factor X CO from integrated CO emission to H 2 surface density decreases modestly as Σ and Σ SFR increase. Star formation rates in dense, turbulent gas are also expected to depend on the gravitational free-fall time at the corresponding mean ISM density ρ 0 ; if the star formation efficiency per free-fall time is ε ff (ρ 0 ) 0.01, the turbulent velocity dispersion driven by feedback is expected to be v z = 0.4 ε ff (ρ 0 ) p * / m * 10 km s –1 , relatively independent of Σ or Σ SFR . Turbulence-regulated starbursts (controlled by kinetic momentum feedback) are part of the larger scheme of self-regulation; primarily atomic low-Σ outer disks may have star formation regulated by ultraviolet heating feedback, whereas regions at extremely high Σ may be regulated by feedback of stellar radiation that is reprocessed into trapped infrared.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z {\textgreater} 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the
volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z {\textasciitilde} 5 and a star
formation rate density which rises at least out to z {\textasciitilde} 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

	abstract = {Feedback from massive stars is one of the least understood aspects of galaxy formation. We perform a suite of vertically stratified local interstellar medium (ISM) models in which supernova (SN) rates and vertical gas column densities are systematically varied based on the Schmidt-Kennicutt law. Our simulations have a sufficiently high spatial resolution (1.95 pc) to follow the hydrodynamic interactions among multiple SNe that structure the interstellar medium. At a given SN rate, we find that the mean mass-weighted sound speed and velocity dispersion decrease as the inverse square root of gas density. The sum of thermal and turbulent pressures is nearly constant in the midplane, so the effective equation of state is isobaric. In contrast, across our four models having SN rates that range from 1 to 512 times the Galactic SN rate, the mass-weighted velocity dispersion remains in the range 4-6 km s –1 . Hence, gas averaged over 100 pc regions follows P \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/vprop.gif] vprop ρ α with α \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] ≈ 1, indicating that the effective equation of state on this scale is close to isothermal. Simulated H I emission lines have widths of 10-18 km s –1 , comparable to observed values. In our highest SN rate model, superbubble blow-outs occur, and the turbulent pressure on large scales is \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] gsim 4 times higher than the thermal pressure. We find a tight correlation between the thermal and turbulent pressures averaged over 100 pc regions in the midplane of each model, as well as across the four ISM models. We construct a subgrid model for turbulent pressure based on analytic arguments and explicitly calibrate it against our stratified ISM simulations. The subgrid model provides a simple yet physically motivated way to include SN feedback in cosmological simulations.},

We have used the TMGS (Two Micron Galactic Survey) database which contains positions and K-magnitudes of about 700.000 stars distributed in serveral regions along the galactic plane. From those we have selected areas more than \$5{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ off the plane to minimize the effect of extinction and the contributions of the young disc; and with longitudes ranging from \$30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ to \$70{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$, to avoid contaminations from the central bulge, the bar and the molecular ring, in the inner end, and from the local arm, the warp and the truncation of the disc, in the outer end. We observed stars with magnitude \$ 9 {\textbackslash}leq m\_K {\textbackslash}leq 10 \$. The use of the NIR K-band also reduces the effect of extinction. In the observation region, m\_K=9.5 mag stars are K2-K5 III stars, with an absolute magnitude that is nearly constant, which also greatly simplifies the problem.

For several decades it has been thought that stellar birth is primarily controlled by the interplay between gravity and magnetostatic support, modulated by ambipolar diffusion. Recently, however, both observational and numerical work has begun to suggest that support by supersonic turbulence rather than magnetic fields controls star formation. In this review we outline a new theory of star formation relying on the control by turbulence. We demonstrate that although supersonic turbulence can provide global support, it nevertheless produces density enhancements that allow local collapse. Inefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of turbulent support, while efficient, clustered star formation occurs in its absence. The consequences of this theory are then explored for both local star formation and galactic scale star formation. (ABSTRACT ABBREVIATED)},

In this paper we review the literature for these baryonic components, reanalyze data, and provide tables of the surface densities and exponential scale heights of main sequence stars, giants, brown dwarfs, and stellar remnants. We also review three components of gas (H2, HI, and HII), give their surface densities at the solar circle, and discuss their vertical distribution. We find a local total surface density of M dwarfs of 17.3 pm 2.3 Mo/pc{\textasciicircum}2. Our result for the total local surface density of visible stars, 27.0 pm 2.7 Mo/pc{\textasciicircum}2, is close to previous estimates due to a cancellation of opposing effects: more mass in M dwarfs, less mass in the others. The total local surface density in white dwarfs is 4.9 pm 0.6 Mo/pc{\textasciicircum}2; in brown dwarfs, it is {\textasciitilde}1.2 Mo/pc{\textasciicircum}2. We find that the total local surface density of stars and stellar remnants is 33.4 pm 3 Mo/pc{\textasciicircum}2, somewhat less than previous estimates. We analyze data on 21 cm emission and absorption and obtain good agreement with recent results on the local amount of neutral atomic hydrogen obtained with the Planck satellite. The local surface density of gas is 13.7 pm 1.6 Mo/pc{\textasciicircum}2. The total baryonic mass surface density that we derive for the solar neighborhood is 47.1 pm 3.4 Mo/pc{\textasciicircum}2. Combining these results with others' measurements of the total surface density of matter within 1-1.1 kpc of the plane, we find that the local density of dark matter is 0.013 pm 0.003Mo/pc{\textasciicircum}3.The local density of all matter is 0.097 pm 0.013 Mo/pc{\textasciicircum}3.

Rather than adopting a parameterized α prescription, we instead use the condition of marginal gravitational instability to self-consistently determine the position- and time-dependent transport rates. We show that there is a steady-state configuration for disks dominated by gravitational instability, and that this steady state persists even when star formation is taken into account if the accretion rate is sufficiently large. For disks in this state, we analytically determine the velocity dispersion, surface density, and rates of mass and angular momentum transport as a function of the gas mass fraction, the rotation curve, and the rate of external accretion onto the disk edge. We show that disks that are initially out of steady state will evolve into it on the viscous timescale of the disk, which is comparable to the orbital period if the accretion rate is high. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the structure of disks in a broad range of environments, including high-redshift galaxies, the outer gaseous disks of local galaxies, and accretion disks around protostars.},

	abstract = {We show that the mass fraction f\_atm = 1.35*MHI/M of neutral atomic gas (HI and He) in isolated local disk galaxies of baryonic mass M is well described by a straightforward stability model for flat exponential disks. In the outer disk parts, where gas at the characteristic dispersion of the warm neutral medium is stable in the sense of Toomre (1964), the disk consists of neutral atomic gas; conversely the inner part where this medium would be Toomre-unstable, is dominated by stars and molecules. Within this model, f\_atm only depends on a global stability parameter q=j*sigma/(GM), where j is the baryonic specific angular momentum of the disk and sigma the velocity dispersion of the atomic gas. The analytically derived first-order solution f\_atm = min\{1,2.5q{\textasciicircum}1.12\} provides a good fit to all plausible rotation curves. This model, with no free parameters, agrees remarkably well (+-0.2 dex) with measurements of f\_atm in isolated local disk galaxies, even with galaxies that are extremely HI-rich or HI-poor for their mass. The finding that f\_atm increases monotonically with q for pure stability reasons offers a powerful intuitive explanation for the mean variation of f\_atm with M: in a cold dark matter universe galaxies are expected to follow j{\textasciitilde}M{\textasciicircum}(2/3), which implies the average scaling q{\textasciitilde}M{\textasciicircum}(-1/3) and hence f\_atm{\textasciitilde}M{\textasciicircum}(-0.37), in agreement with observations.},

The disks are self-gravitating, contain metals and dust, and are exposed to UV radiation. We find that the critical surface density for the existence of a cold interstellar phase depends only weakly on the parameters of the model and coincides with the empirically derived surface density threshold for star formation. Furthermore, it is shown that the drop in the thermal velocity dispersion associated with the transition from the warm to the cold gas phase triggers gravitational instability on a wide range of scales. The presence of strong turbulence does not undermine this conclusion if the disk is self-gravitating. Models based on the hypothesis that the onset of thermal instability determines the star formation threshold in the outer parts of galaxies can reproduce many observations, including the threshold radii, column densities, and the sizes of stellar disks as a function of disk scale length and mass. Finally, prescriptions are given for implementing star formation thresholds in (semi-)analytic models and three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation.},

We introduce a new SFR index based on a linear combination of H-alpha emission-line and 24 micron continuum luminosities, that provides reliable extinction-corrected ionizing fluxes and SFR densities over a wide range of dust attenuations. The combination of these extinction-corrected SFR densities with aperture synthesis HI and CO maps has allowed us to probe the form of the spatially-resolved star formation law on scales of 0.5 to 2 kpc. We find that the resolved SFR vs gas surface density relation is well represented by a Schmidt power law, which is similar in form and dispersion to the disk-averaged Schmidt law. We observe a comparably strong correlation of the SFR surface density with the molecular gas surface density, but no significant correlation with the surface density of atomic gas. The best-fitting slope of the Schmidt law varies from N = 1.37 to 1.56, with zeropoint and slope that change systematically with the spatial sampling scale. We tentatively attribute these variations to the effects of areal sampling and averaging of a nonlinear intrinsic star formation law. Our data can also be fitted by an alternative parametrization of the SFR surface density in terms of the ratio of gas surface density to local dynamical time, but with a considerable dispersion.},

A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation -- turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity -- are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes.},

	abstract = {When averaged over large scales, star formation in galaxies is observed to follow the empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law for surface densities above a constant threshold. While the observed law involves surface densities, theoretical models and simulations generally work with volume density laws (i.e. Schmidt laws). We derive analytic relations between star formation laws expressed in terms of surface densities, volume densities, and pressures and we show how these relations depend on parameters such as the effective equation of state of the multiphase interstellar medium. Our analytic relations enable us to implement observed surface density laws into simulations. Because the parameters of our prescription for star formation are observables, we are not free to tune them to match the observations. We test our theoretical framework using high-resolution simulations of isolated disc galaxies that assume an effective equation of state for the multiphase interstellar medium. We are able to reproduce the star formation threshold and both the slope and the normalisation of arbitrary input KS laws without tuning any parameters and with very little scatter, even for unstable galaxies and even if we use poor numerical resolution. Moreover, we can do so for arbitrary effective equations of state. Our prescription therefore enables simulations of galaxies to bypass our current inability to simulate the formation of stars. On the other hand, the fact that we can reproduce arbitrary input thresholds and KS laws, rather than just the particular ones picked out by nature, indicates that simulations that lack the physics and/or resolution to simulate the multiphase interstellar medium can only provide limited insight into the origin of the observed star formation laws.},

evolution vs. theoretical models and relate it to the evolution in
galaxy morphology. A key point that has emerged from this activity is
that substantial fractions of high-redshift galaxies have regular
kinematic morphologies despite irregular photometric morphologies and
this is likely due to the presence of a large number of highly gas-rich
discs. There has not yet been a review of this burgeoning topic. In this

	abstract = {Determining the global properties of the Milky Way presents unique 
challenges. Our position within the disk of the Galaxy yields a
distorted view of its overall light emission; interstellar dust alters
the spectral energy density we would otherwise measure in complex ways.
For this reason, measurements of the global properties of the Milky Way,
such as its star formation rate and total stellar mass, have proven to
be historically difficult and remain sparsely studied within the
literature. Here, we utilize updated models of the components of the
Milky Way and constraints from similar galaxies to determine improved
estimates of its total stellar mass. We model the stellar composition of
the Galaxy as an exponential disk, both thin and thick components,
combined with additional mass contributions from a central bulge,
pseudo-bulge, and/or bar (halo contributions are negligible compared to
current uncertainties). We constrain this model with a variety of
measurements from the literature, taking into account the uncertainties
in these estimates. With conservative assumptions we find that the total
stellar mass of the Milky Way is 4.6 (median) +2.0/-1.3 (68\% limit)
×1010 Msun (or +8.2/-2.0
×1010 Msun at 95\% confidence). We then
employ a random selection process that yields a sample of SDSS galaxies
whose distribution in stellar mass and star formation rate matches what
we know about the Milky Way’s (incorporating all uncertainties).
By analyzing the properties of these Milky Way analog galaxies, after
correcting for inclination effects and Eddington bias, we find that the
color of our Galaxy is g-r = 0.671 +0.061/-0.073 mag, and its absolute
magnitude is Mr = -20.87 +0.33/-0.44 mag. We therefore find
that the Milky Way most likely lies in the saddle of the bimodal
distribution of red and blue galaxies.},

	abstract = {[abridged] While observations of Local Group galaxies show a very simple, local star formation law in which the star formation rate per unit area in each patch of a galaxy scales linearly with the molecular gas surface density, recent observations of both Milky Way molecular clouds and high redshift galaxies apparently show a more complicated relationship, in which regions of equal surface density can form stars at quite different rates. These data have been interpreted as implying either that different star formation laws apply in different circumstances, that the star formation law is sensitive to large-scale galaxy properties rather than local properties, or that there are high density thresholds for star formation. Here we collate resolved observations of Milky Way molecular clouds, kpc-scale observations of Local Group galaxies, and unresolved observations of both disk and starburst galaxies in the local universe and at high redshift. We show that all of these data are in fact consistent with a simple, local, volumetric star formation law. The apparent variations stem from the fact that the observed objects have a wide variety of 3D size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even at fixed gas column density the regions being observed can have wildly varying volume densities. We provide a simple theoretical framework to remove this projection effect, and we show that all the data, from small Solar neighborhood clouds with masses {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}3 Msun to sub-mm galaxies with masses {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun, fall on a single star formation law in which the SFR is simply {\textasciitilde}1\% of the molecular gas mass per local free-fall time. In contrast, proposed star formation laws in which the star formation timescale is set by the galactic rotation period or the SFR is linearly proportional to the gas mass above some density threshold fail to match at least some of the data.},

	abstract = {We present a model for star formation and supernova feedback that describes the multiphase structure of star-forming gas on scales that are typically not resolved in cosmological simulations. Our approach includes radiative heating and cooling, the growth of cold clouds embedded in an ambient hot medium, star formation in these clouds, feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal heating and cloud evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal enrichment. Implemented using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, our scheme is a significantly modified and extended version of the grid-based method of Yepes et al., and enables us to achieve a high dynamic range in simulations of structure formation.
We discuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it predicts a self-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in particular, stabilizes the star-forming gaseous layers of disc galaxies. The parametrization of this mode can be reduced to a single free quantity that determines the overall time-scale for star formation. We fix this parameter numerically to match the observed rates of star formation in local disc galaxies. When normalized in this manner, cosmological simulations employing our model nevertheless overproduce the observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated to extend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with star formation.
Using small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disc galaxies, we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or outflows, depending on the depth of the gravitational potential. In low-mass haloes, winds can greatly suppress the overall efficiency of star formation. When incorporated into cosmological simulations, our combined model for star formation and winds predicts a cosmic star formation density that is consistent with observations, provided that the winds are sufficiently energetic. Moreover, outflows from galaxies in these simulations drive chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium — in principle, accounting for the presence of metals in the Lyman α forest.},

	abstract = {We study the population of galactic discs expected in current hierarchical clustering models for structure formation. A rotationally supported disc with exponential surface density profile is assumed to form with a mass and angular momentum which are fixed fractions of those of its surrounding dark halo. We assume that haloes respond
adiabatically to disc formation, and that only stable discs can
correspond to real systems. With these assumptions the predicted population can match both present-day discs and the damped Lyalpha absorbers in QSO spectra. Good agreement is found provided that: (i) the masses of discs are a few per cent of those of their haloes; (ii) the specific angular momenta of discs are similar to those of their haloes; (iii) present-day discs were assembled recently (at z{\textless}=1). In
particular, the observed scatter in the size-rotation velocity plane is reproduced, as are the slope and scatter of the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation. The zero-point of the TF relation is matched for a stellar mass-to-light ratio of 1 to 2 h in the I-band, consistent with
observational values derived from disc dynamics. High-redshift discs are predicted to be small and dense, and could plausibly merge together to form the observed population of elliptical galaxies. In many (but not all) currently popular cosmogonies, discs with rotation velocities exceeding 200 kms{\textasciicircum}-1 can account for a third or more of the observed damped Lyalpha systems at z{\textasciitilde}2.5. Half of the lines of sight to such systems are predicted to intersect the absorber at r{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}3h{\textasciicircum}-1kpc and about 10 per cent at r{\textgreater}10h{\textasciicircum}-1kpc. The cross-section for absorption is strongly weighted towards discs with large angular momentum and
therefore large size for their mass. The galaxy population associated with damped absorbers should thus be biased towards low surface
brightness systems.},

The procedure amounts to introducing an artificial controlled parameter which can be tuned in such a way that the so-called projected dynamics becomes explicit and the GLE reduces to a Markovian equation. The projected dynamics can be realised in practice by introducing constraints, and it is shown that the Green–Kubo formulae computed with these dynamics do not suffer from the plateau problem. The methodology is illustrated in the example of star polymer molecules in a melt using their center of mass as relevant variables. Through this example, we show that not only the effective potentials, but also the friction forces and the noise play a very important role in the dynamics.},

Its 21-cm emission line is a key probe of the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way Galaxy. About 50 years after the first detection of the 21-cm line the exploration of the Hi distribution of the Milky Way has undergone a true renaissance. This was triggered by several large-scale 21-cm surveys that became available within the past decade. New all-sky surveys unravel the shape and volume density distribution of the gaseous disk up to its borders. High-resolution Galactic plane surveys disclose a wealth of shells, filaments, and spurs that bear witness to the recycling of matter between stars and the ISM. All these observational results indicate that the Hi gas traces a dynamical Galactic ISM with structures on all scales, from tens of astronomical units to kiloparsecs. The Galaxy can be considered to be a violent, breathing disk surrounded by highly turbulent extra-planar gas.},

Because of the low optical depth at 240 μm, the FIR emission traces the distribution of Galactic dust in the Galaxy. We model the dust distribution as due to three components: a warped exponential disk with scale length 0.28 R ☉ and a flaring scale height, a spiral arm component with four arms as traced by Galactic H II regions, and the local (Orion) arm, which produces prominent emission features at Galactic longitudes l \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] simeq 80 and -100°. A cosmic infrared background of 1.07 MJy sr -1 is recovered, consistent with previous determinations. The dust distribution is then used to calculate absorption in J and K , and the stellar emission in these wavebands is modeled with two components: a warped exponential disk with a scale length of 0.28 R ☉ and a spiral arm component dominated by two arms. This small scale length is consistent with a maximal disk model for our Galaxy, which is inconsistent with the cuspy dark matter halos predicted in CDM models.

	abstract = {The energy and momentum feedback from young stars has a profound impact on the interstellar medium (ISM), including heating and driving turbulence in the neutral gas that fuels future star formation. Recent theory has argued that this leads to a quasi-equilibrium self-regulated state, and for outer atomic-dominated disks results in the surface density of star formation \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{SFR\}\$ varying approximately linearly with the weight of the ISM (or midplane turbulent + thermal pressure). We use three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic simulations to test the theoretical predictions for thermal, turbulent, and vertical dynamical equilibrium, and the implied functional dependence of \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{SFR\}\$ on local disk properties. Our models demonstrate that all equilibria are established rapidly, and that the expected proportionalities between mean thermal and turbulent pressures and \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{SFR\}\$ apply. For outer disk regions, this results in \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_\{SFR\} {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}Sigma {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}rho\_\{sd\}\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}Sigma\$ is the total gas surface density and \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{sd\}\$ is the midplane density of the stellar disk (plus dark matter). This scaling law arises because \${\textbackslash}rho\_\{sd\}\$ sets the vertical dynamical time in our models (and outer disk regions generally). The coefficient in the star formation law varies inversely with the specific energy and momentum yield from massive stars. We find proportions of warm and cold atomic gas, turbulent-to-thermal pressure, and mean velocity dispersions that are consistent with Solar-neighborhood and other outer-disk observations. This study confirms the conclusions of a previous set of simulations, which incorporated the same physics treatment but was restricted to radial-vertical slices through the ISM.},

We do so by combining previous measurements from the literature using a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) statistical method that allows us to account for the possibility that any value may be incorrect or have underestimated errors. We show that this method is robust to a wide variety of assumptions about the nature of problems in individual measurements or error estimates. Ultimately, our analysis yields a SFR for the Galaxy of \${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\}\_{\textbackslash}star=1.65{\textbackslash}pm0.19\$ \${\textbackslash}textrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}textrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, assuming a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). By combining HB methods with Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate the latest estimates of the Galactocentric radius of the Sun, \$R\_0\$, the exponential scale length of the disk, \$L\_d\$, and the local surface density of stellar mass, \${\textbackslash}Sigma\_{\textbackslash}star(R\_0)\$, we show that the mass of the Galactic bulge+bar is \${\textbackslash}textrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star{\textasciicircum}B=0.91{\textbackslash}pm0.07{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ \${\textbackslash}textrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, the disk mass is \${\textbackslash}textrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star{\textasciicircum}D=5.17{\textbackslash}pm1.11{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ \${\textbackslash}textrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, and their combination yields a total stellar mass of \${\textbackslash}textrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star=6.08{\textbackslash}pm1.14{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ \${\textbackslash}textrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ (assuming a Kroupa IMF and an exponential disk profile). This analysis is based upon a new compilation of literature bulge mass estimates, normalized to common assumptions about the stellar initial mass function and Galactic disk properties, presented herein. We additionally find a bulge-to-total mass ratio for the Milky Way of \$B/T=0.150{\textasciicircum}\{+0.028\}\_\{-0.019\}\$ and a specific star formation rate of \${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\}\_{\textbackslash}star/{\textbackslash}textrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}star=2.71{\textbackslash}pm0.59{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-11\} {\textbackslash}textrm\{yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$.},

The main purpose is to allow for memory effects or causal time behavior, so that the response to a thermodynamic force comes later than the application of the force. This is accomplished by a statistical mechanical derivation of an exact non-Markoffian kinetic equation for the probability distribution in the space of macroscopic state variables. The memory effect in the resulting transport equations is represented by a time convolution of the thermodynamic forces with memory functions. The latter are time-correlation functions in the rates of change of the phase functions corresponding to macroscopic quantities. The resulting transport equations are not restricted to small deviations from thermal equilibrium. Onsager's theory is shown to be the low-frequency limit of our causal theory.},

We present and test a sub-grid recipe to model feedback from massive stars in cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. The energy is distributed in kinetic form among the gas particles surrounding recently formed stars. The impact of the feedback is studied using a suite of high-resolution simulations of isolated disc galaxies embedded in dark halos with total mass 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\} and 10{\textasciicircum}\{12\} Msol/h. We focus in particular on the effect of pressure forces on wind particles within the disc, which we turn off temporarily in some of our runs to mimic a recipe that has been widely used in the literature. We find that this popular recipe gives dramatically different results because (ram) pressure forces on expanding superbubbles determine both the structure of the disc and the development of large-scale outflows. Pressure forces exerted by expanding superbubbles puff up the disc, giving the dwarf galaxy an irregular morphology and creating a galactic fountain in the massive galaxy. Hydrodynamic drag within the disc results in a strong increase of the effective mass loading of the wind for the dwarf galaxy, but quenches much of the outflow in the case of the high-mass galaxy.},

	abstract = {Star formation is slow, in the sense that the gas consumption time is much longer than the dynamical time. It is also inefficient; essentially all star formation in local galaxies takes place in giant molecular clouds (GMCs), but the fraction of a GMC converted to stars is very small, {\textasciitilde}5\%. In the most luminous starbursts, the GMC lifetime is shorter than the main sequence lifetime of even the most massive stars, so that supernovae can play no role in GMC disruption. We investigate the disruption of GMCs across a wide range of galaxies, from normal spirals to the densest starbursts; we take into account the effects of HII gas pressure, shocked stellar winds, protostellar jets, and radiation pressure produced by the absorption and scattering of starlight on dust grains. In the Milky Way, we find that a combination of three mechanisms, jets, HII gas pressure, and radiation pressure, disrupts the clouds. In more rapidly star forming galaxies such as ``clump'' galaxies at high-redshift, ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and submillimeter galaxies, radiation pressure dominates natal cloud distribution. We predict the presence of 10-20 clusters with masses {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}7 Msun in local ULIRGs such as Arp 220 and a similar number of clusters with M\_* {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}8 Msun in high redshift clump galaxies; submillimeter galaxies will have even more massive clusters. We find that the mass fraction of a GMC that ends up in stars is an increasing function of the gas surface density of a galaxy, reaching {\textasciitilde}35\% in the most luminous starbursts. Furthermore, the disruption of bubbles by radiation pressure stirs the interstellar medium to velocities of {\textasciitilde}10 km/s in normal galaxies and to {\textasciitilde}100 km/s in ULIRGs like Arp 220, consistent with observations. Thus, radiation pressure may play a dominant role in the ISM of star-forming galaxies.},

	abstract = {We present a two-zone theory for feedback-regulated star formation in galactic discs, consistently connecting the galaxy-averaged star formation law with star formation proceeding in giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Our focus is on galaxies with gas surface density Σg ≳ 100 M⊙ pc−2, where the interstellar medium (ISM) can be assumed to be fully molecular. This regime includes most star formation in the Universe and our basic framework can be extended to other galaxies. In our theory, the galactic disc consists of Toomre-mass GMCs embedded in a volume-filling ISM. Radiation pressure on dust disperses GMCs and most supernovae explode in the volume-filling medium. A galaxy-averaged star formation law is derived by balancing the momentum input from supernova feedback with the vertical gravitational weight of the disc gas. This star formation law is in good agreement with observations for a CO conversion factor depending continuously on Σg. We argue that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free-fall time, ϵgalffϵffgal{\textbackslash}epsilon \_\{{\textbackslash}rm ff\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm gal\}, is only a weak function of the efficiency with which GMCs convert their gas into stars, ϵGMCintϵintGMC{\textbackslash}epsilon \_\{{\textbackslash}rm int\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm GMC\}. This is possible because the rate limiting step for star formation is the rate at which GMCs form: for large efficiency of star formation in GMCs, the Toomre Q parameter obtains a value slightly above unity so that the GMC formation rate is consistent with the galaxy-averaged star formation law. We contrast our results with other theories of turbulence-regulated star formation and discuss predictions of our model. Using a compilation of data from the literature, we show that the galaxy-averaged star formation efficiency per free-fall time is non-universal and increases with increasing gas fraction, as predicted by our model. We also predict that the fraction of the disc gas mass in bound GMCs decreases for increasing values of the GMC star formation efficiency. This is qualitatively consistent with the smooth molecular gas distribution inferred in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies and the small mass fraction in giant clumps in high-redshift galaxies.},

	abstract = {Supernova (SN) feedback is one of the key processes shaping the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. SNe contribute to (and in some cases may dominate) driving turbulence in the ISM and accelerating galactic winds. Modern cosmological simulations have sufficient resolution to capture the main structures in the ISM of galaxies, but are typically still not capable of explicitly resolving all of the small-scale stellar feedback processes, including the expansion of supernova remnants (SNRs). We perform a series of controlled three-dimensional hydrodynamic (adaptive mesh refinement) simulations of single SNRs expanding in an inhomogeneous density field with statistics motivated by those of the turbulent ISM. We use these to quantify the momentum and thermal energy injection from SNe as a function of spatial scale and the density, metallicity, and structure of the ambient medium. We develop a series of analytic formulae that we fit to the simulations. These formulae can be used as a basis for a more predictive sub-resolution model for SN feedback for galaxy formation simulations. We then use simulations of multiple, stochastically driven SNe that resolve the key phases of SNRs to test the sub-resolution model, and show that it accurately captures the turbulent kinetic energy and thermal energy in the ISM. By contrast, proposed SN feedback models in the literature based on `delayed cooling' significantly overpredict the late-time thermal energy and momentum in SNRs.},

	abstract = {We present evidence that bona fide disks and starburst systems occupy distinct regions in the gas mass versus star formation rate (SFR) plane, both for the integrated quantities and for the respective surface densities. This result is based on carbon monoxide (CO) observations of galaxy populations at low and high redshifts, and on the current consensus for the CO luminosity to gas mass conversion factors. The data suggest the existence of two different SF regimes: a long-lasting mode for disks and a more rapid mode for starbursts, the latter probably occurring during major mergers or in dense nuclear SF regions. Both modes are observable over a large range of SFRs. The detection of CO emission from distant near-IR selected galaxies reveals such bimodal behavior for the first time, as they allow us to probe gas in disk galaxies with much higher SFRs than are seen locally. The different regimes can potentially be interpreted as the effect of a top-heavy initial mass function in starbursts. However, we favor a different physical origin related to the fraction of molecular gas in dense clouds. The IR luminosity to gas mass ratio (i.e., the SF efficiency) appears to be inversely proportional to the dynamical (rotation) timescale. Only when accounting for the dynamical timescale, a universal SF law is obtained, suggesting a direct link between global galaxy properties and the local SFR.},

We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and AGN in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the z{\textasciitilde}0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.2\$ dex over the full mass range, \$10{\textasciicircum}8 {\textless} M\_*/M\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for \$M\_* {\textbackslash}gtrsim 10{\textasciicircum}9 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback.

	abstract = {(Abridged) We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between star formation rate surface density (SFR SD) and gas surface density (gas SD) at sub-kpc resolution in a sample of 18 nearby galaxies. We use high resolution HI data from THINGS, CO data from HERACLES and BIMA SONG, 24 micron data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and UV data from GALEX. We target 7 spiral galaxies and 11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation law differs between the H2-dominated centers of spiral galaxies, their HI-dominated outskirts and the HI-rich late-type/dwarf galaxies. We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N=1.0+-0.2 relates the SFR SD and the H2 SD across our sample of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H2 forms stars at a constant efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is {\textasciitilde}2*10{\textasciicircum}9 yrs. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion time as evidence that stars are forming in GMCs with approximately uniform properties and that the H2 SD may be more a measure of the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than changing conditions in the molecular gas. The relationship between total gas SD and SFR SD varies dramatically among and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show little or no correlation between the HI SD and the SFR SD. As a result, the star formation efficiency (SFE = SFR SD / gas SD) varies strongly across our sample and within individual galaxies. We show that in spirals the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the dwarf galaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to those found in the outer optical disks of the spirals. Another general feature of our sample is a sharp saturation of the HI SD at {\textasciitilde}9 M\_sol/pc{\textasciicircum}2 in both the spiral and dwarf galaxies.},

We argue that the main cause of the catastrophic cooling is a mismatch between the mass of the gas in which the energy is injected and the mass of the parent stellar population. Because too much mass is heated, the temperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic arguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical resolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected thermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy. We then propose and test a stochastic implementation of thermal feedback that uses this minimum temperature increase as an input parameter and that can be employed in both particle- and grid-based codes. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to test the method on models of isolated disc galaxies in dark matter haloes with total mass 10{\textasciicircum}10 and 10{\textasciicircum}12 h{\textasciicircum}-1 solar masses. The thermal feedback strongly suppresses the star formation rate and can drive massive, large-scale outflows without the need to turn off radiative cooling temporarily. In accord with expectations derived from analytic arguments, for sufficiently high resolution the results become insensitive to the imposed temperature jump and also agree with high-resolution simulations employing kinetic feedback.},

	abstract = {We introduce the Illustris Project, a series of large-scale hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation. The highest resolution simulation, Illustris-1, covers a volume of \$(106.5{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}){\textasciicircum}3\$, has a dark mass resolution of \$\{6.26 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, and an initial baryonic matter mass resolution of \$\{1.26 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. At \$z=0\$ gravitational forces are softened on scales of \$710{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm pc\}\$, and the smallest hydrodynamical gas cells have an extent of \$48{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm pc\}\$. We follow the dynamical evolution of \$2{\textbackslash}times 1820{\textasciicircum}3\$ resolution elements and in addition passively evolve \$1820{\textasciicircum}3\$ Monte Carlo tracer particles reaching a total particle count of more than \$18\$ billion. The galaxy formation model includes: primordial and metal-line cooling with self-shielding corrections, stellar evolution, stellar feedback, gas recycling, chemical enrichment, supermassive black hole growth, and feedback from active galactic nuclei. At \$z=0\$ our simulation volume contains about \$40,000\$ well-resolved galaxies covering a diverse range of morphologies and colours including early-type, late-type and irregular galaxies. The simulation reproduces reasonably well the cosmic star formation rate density, the galaxy luminosity function, and baryon conversion efficiency at \$z=0\$. It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disk galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies. Our model predicts a halo mass dependent impact of baryonic effects on the halo mass function and the masses of haloes caused by feedback from supernova and active galactic nuclei.},

	abstract = {Galaxies' interstellar media (ISM) are observed to be supersonically-turbulent, but the ultimate power source that drives turbulent motion remains uncertain. The two dominant models are that the turbulence is driven by star formation feedback and/or that it is produced by gravitational instability in the gas. Here we show that, while both models predict that the galaxies' ISM velocity dispersions will be positively correlated with their star formation rates, the forms of the correlation predicted by these two models are subtly but measurably different. A feedback-driven origin for the turbulence predicts a velocity dispersion that rises more sharply with star formation rate, and that does not depend on the gas fraction (i.e. \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_* {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}sigma{\textasciicircum}2\$), while a gravity-driven model yields a shallower rise and a strong dependence on gas fraction (i.e. \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_* {\textbackslash}propto f\_g{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}sigma\$). We compare the models to a collection of data on local and high-redshift galaxies culled from the literature, and show that the correlation expected for gravity-driven turbulence is a better match to the observations than a feedback-driven model. This suggests that gravity is the ultimate source of ISM turbulence, at least in the rapidly-star-forming, high velocity dispersion galaxies for which our test is most effective. We conclude by discussing the limitations of the present data set, and the prospects for future measurements to enable a more definitive test of the two models.},

	abstract = {Feedback from massive stars is believed to play a critical role in driving galactic super-winds that enrich the IGM and shape the galaxy mass function and mass-metallicity relation. In previous papers, we introduced new numerical methods for implementing stellar feedback on sub-GMC through galactic scales in galaxy simulations. This includes radiation pressure (UV through IR), SNe (Type-I \& II), stellar winds ('fast' O-star through 'slow' AGB winds), and HII photoionization. Here, we show that these feedback mechanisms drive galactic winds with outflow rates as high as {\textasciitilde}10-20 times the galaxy SFR. The mass-loading efficiency (wind mass loss rate divided by SFR) scales inversely with circular velocity, consistent with momentum-conservation expectations. We study the contributions of each feedback mechanism to galactic winds in a range of galaxy models, from SMC-like dwarfs \& MW-analogues to z{\textasciitilde}2 clumpy disks. In massive, gas-rich systems (local starbursts and high-z galaxies), radiation pressure dominates the wind generation. For MW-like spirals and dwarf galaxies the gas densities are much lower, and shock-heated gas from SNe and stellar winds dominates production of large-scale outflows. In all models, however, winds have a multi-phase structure that depends on interactions between multiple feedback mechanisms operating on different spatial \& time scales: any single mechanism fails to reproduce the winds observed. We provide fitting functions for wind mass-loading and velocities as a function of galaxy properties, for use in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. These differ from typically-adopted formulae with explicit dependence on gas surface density that can be very important in both low-density dwarf galaxies and high-density gas-rich galaxies.},

	abstract = {We derive the mass model of the Milky Way (MW) using a cored dark matter (DM) halo profile and recent data. The method used consists in fitting a spherically symmetric model of the Galaxy with a Burkert DM halo profile to available data: MW terminal velocities in the region inside the solar circle, circular velocity as recently estimated from maser star forming regions at intermediate radii, and velocity dispersions of stellar halo tracers for the outermost Galactic region. The latter are reproduced by integrating the Jeans equation for every modeled mass distribution, and by allowing for different velocity anisotropies for different tracer populations. For comparison we also consider a Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We find that the cored profile is the preferred one, with a shallow central density of rho\_H{\textasciitilde}4x10{\textasciicircum}7M\_s/kpc{\textasciicircum}3 and a large core radius R\_H{\textasciitilde}10 kpc, as observed in external spirals and in agreement with the mass model underlying the Universal Rotation Curve of spirals. We describe also the derived model uncertainties, which are crucially driven by the poorly constrained velocity dispersion anisotropies of halo tracers. The emerging cored DM distribution has implications for the DM annihilation angular profile, which is much less boosted in the Galactic center direction with respect to the case of the standard {\textbackslash}Lambda CDM, NFW profile. Using the derived uncertainties we discuss finally the limitations and prospects to discriminate between cored and cusped DM profile with a possible observed diffuse DM annihilation signal. The present mass model aims to characterize the present-day description of the distribution of matter in our Galaxy, which is needed to frame current crucial issues of Cosmology, Astrophysics and Elementary Particles.},

Thanks to gravitational magnification of 1.4 - 90x by foreground clusters, effective spatial resolutions of 40 - 700 pc are achieved. The magnification also allows us to probe lower star formation rates and stellar masses than unlensed samples; our target galaxies feature dust-corrected SFRs derived from Ha or Hb emission of 0.8 - 40Msol/yr, and stellar masses M* {\textasciitilde} 4e8 - 6e10 Msol.

However, systematic studies quantifying the impact of SNe in realistic inhomogeneous ISM conditions have been lacking. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the dependence of radial momentum injection on both physical conditions (considering a range of mean density n 0 = 0.1– \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/802/2/99/apj508258ieqn1.gif] \$100{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}rm c{\textbackslash}rm m{\textasciicircum}-3\$ ) and numerical parameters. Our inhomogeneous simulations adopt two-phase background states that result from thermal instability in atomic gas.

Initial experiments with multiple spatially correlated SNe show a momentum per event nearly as large as single-SN cases.

	abstract = {The interstellar medium (ISM) is subject, on one hand, to heating and cooling processes that tend to segregate it into distinct phases due to thermal instability (TI), and on the other, to turbulence-driving mechanisms that tend to produce strong nonlinear fluctuations in all the thermodynamic variables. In this regime, large-scale turbulent compressions in the stable warm neutral medium (WNM) dominate the clump-formation process rather than the linear developent of TI. Cold clumps formed by this mechanism are often bounded by sharp density and temperature discontinuities, which however are not contact discontinuities as in the classical 2-phase model, but rather "phase transition fronts", across which there is net mass and momentum flux from the WNM into the clumps. The clumps grow mainly by accretion through their boundaries, are in both thermal and ram pressure balance with their surroundings, and are internally turbulent as well, thus also having significant density fluctuations inside. The temperature and density of the cold and warm gas around the phase transition fronts fluctuate with time and location due to fluctuations in the turbulent pressure. Moreover, shock-compressed diffuse unstable gas can remain in the unstable regime for up to a few Myr before it undergoes a phase transition to the cold phase. These processes populate the classically forbidden density and temperature ranges. Since gas at all temperatures appears to be present in bi- or tri-stable turbulence, we conclude that the word "phase" applies only locally, surrounding phase transition sites in the gas. Globally, the word "phase" must relax its meaning to simply denote a certain temperature or density range.},

Here we consider another possibility, where the perturbation is instead due to the potential of a galaxy cluster. Using N -body simulations we investigate the formation and evolution of spiral arms in a Milky-Way-like galaxy orbiting a Virgo-like cluster. The galaxy is placed on a few orbits of different size but similar eccentricity and its evolution are followed for 10 Gyr. The tidally induced, two-armed, approximately logarithmic spiral structure forms on each of them during the pericenter passages. The spiral arms dissipate and wind up with time, to be triggered again at the next pericenter passage. We confirm this transient and recurrent nature of the arms by analyzing the time evolution of the pitch angle and the arm strength. We find that the strongest arms are formed on the tightest orbit; however, they wind up rather quickly and are disturbed by another pericenter passage. The arms on the most extended orbit, which we analyze in more detail, wind up slowly and survive for the longest time. Measurements of the pattern speed of the arms indicate that they are kinematic density waves. We attempt a comparison with observations by selecting grand-design spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster. Among those, we find nine examples bearing no sign of recent interactions or the presence of companions. For three of them we present close structural analogues among our simulated spiral galaxies.},

	abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from
simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its
concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are
significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate
estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

	abstract = {The SILCC project (SImulating the Life-Cycle of molecular Clouds) aims at a more self-consistent understanding of the interstellar medium (ISM) on small scales and its link to galaxy evolution. We present three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of the ISM in a vertically stratified box including self-gravity, an external potential due to the stellar component of the galactic disc, and stellar feedback in the form of an interstellar radiation field and supernovae (SNe). The cooling of the gas is based on a chemical network that follows the abundances of H+, H, H2, C+, and CO and takes shielding into account consistently. We vary the SN feedback by comparing different SN rates, clustering and different positioning, in particular SNe in density peaks and at random positions, which has a major impact on the dynamics. Only for random SN positions the energy is injected in sufficiently low-density environments to reduce energy losses and enhance the effective kinetic coupling of the SNe with the gas. This leads to more realistic velocity dispersions ({\textbackslash}sigma\_HI {\textasciitilde} 0.8{\textbackslash}sigma\_(300-8000K) {\textasciitilde} 10-20km/s, {\textbackslash}sigma\_H{\textbackslash}alpha {\textasciitilde} 0.6{\textbackslash}sigma\_(8000-3e5K) {\textasciitilde} 20-30km/s), and strong outflows with mass loading factors of up to 10 even for solar neighbourhood conditions. Clustered SNe abet the onset of outflows compared to individual SNe but do not influence the net outflow rate. The outflows do not contain any molecular gas and are mainly composed of atomic hydrogen. The bulk of the outflowing mass is dense ({\textbackslash}rho {\textasciitilde} 1e-25-1e-24g/cc) and slow (v {\textasciitilde} 20-40km/s) but there is a high-velocity tail of up to v {\textasciitilde} 500km/s with {\textbackslash}rho {\textasciitilde} 1e-28-1e-27g/cc.},

	abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree'-method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different timesteps. Individual and adaptive short-range timesteps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelisation algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10{\textasciicircum}10 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 10{\textasciicircum}5 per dimension in a 3D box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

This suggests an intrinsic relation between stars and gas at cell-size scales, which dominates over the global dynamical evolution. To investigate this effect, we develop a method to simulate the creation of stars based on the density field from the snapshots, without running the code again. We also investigate how the star formation law is affected by the characteristic star formation timescale, the density threshold, and the efficiency considered in the recipe. We find that the slope of the law varies from 1.4 for a free-fall timescale, to 1.0 for a constant depletion timescale.

The models are global and three-dimensional, and they include a treatment of star formation and feedback. We examine the formation of gravitational instabilities and show that a form of the Toomre
instability criterion can successfully predict where star formation will occur. Two common prescriptions for star formation are investigated. The first is based on cosmological simulations and has a relatively low threshold for star formation but also enforces a comparatively low efficiency. The second only permits star formation above a number density of 103 cm-3 but adopts a high efficiency. We show that both methods can reproduce the observed slope of the relationship between star formation and gas surface density (although at too high a rate for our adopted parameters). A run that includes feedback from Type II supernovae is successful at driving gas out of the plane, most of which falls back onto the disk. This feedback also substantially reduces the star formation rate. Finally, we examine the density and pressure distribution of the ISM and show that there is a rough pressure equilibrium in the disk, but with a wide range of pressures at a given location (and even wider for the case including feedback).},

	abstract = {We consider the effects of different criteria for determining where 
stars will form in gas on galactic scales, in simulations with high (1
pc) resolution, with explicitly resolved physics of Giant Molecular
Cloud (GMC) formation and destruction, and stellar feedback from
supernovae, radiation pressure, stellar winds and photoheating. We
compare: (1) a self-gravity criterion (based on the local virial
parameter and the assumption that self-gravitating gas collapses to high
density in a single free-fall time), (2) a fixed density threshold, (3)
a molecular-gas law, (4) a temperature threshold, (5) a requirement that
the gas be Jeans unstable, (6) a criteria that cooling times be shorter
than dynamical times and (7) a convergent-flow criterion. We consider
all of these in both a Milky Way (MW)-like and high-density (starburst
or high-redshift) galaxy. With feedback present, all models produce
identical integrated star formation rates (SFRs), in good agreement with
the Kennicutt relation; without feedback all produce orders-of-magnitude
excessive SFRs. This is totally dependent on feedback and independent of
the star formation (SF) law, even if the `local' collapse efficiency is
100 per cent. However, the predicted spatial and density distribution
depend strongly on the SF criteria. Because cooling rates are generally
fast within galaxy discs, and gas is turbulent, criteria (4)-(7) are
very `weak' and spread the SF uniformly over most of the disc (down to
densities n ˜ 0.01-0.1 cm-3). A molecular criterion (3)
localizes to slightly higher densities, but still a wide range; for
metallicity near solar, it is almost identical to a fixed density
threshold at n ˜ 1 cm-3 (well below the mean density in
the central MW or starburst systems). A fixed density threshold (2) can
always select the highest resolved densities, but must be adjusted both
for simulation resolution and individual galaxy properties - the same
threshold that works well in a MW-like simulation will select nearly all
gas in a starburst. Binding criteria (1) tend to adaptively select the
largest local overdensities, independent of galaxy model or resolution,
and automatically predict clustered SF. We argue that this SF model
(possible with other secondary criteria) is most physically motivated
and presents significant numerical advantages in simulations with a
large dynamic range.},

We evolve a suite of five halos to z = 0 and find a gas disk formation in each; however, in agreement with previous smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations (that did not include a subgrid feedback model), the rotation curves of all halos are centrally peaked due to a massive spheroidal component. Our standard model includes radiative cooling and star formation, but no feedback. We further investigate this angular momentum problem by systematically modifying various simulation parameters including: (1) spatial resolution, ranging from 1700 to 212 pc; (2) an additional pressure component to ensure that the Jeans length is always resolved; (3) low star formation efficiency, going down to 0.1\%; (4) fixed physical resolution as opposed to comoving resolution; (5) a supernova feedback model that injects thermal energy to the local cell; and (6) a subgrid feedback model which suppresses cooling in the immediate vicinity of a star formation event. Of all of these, we find that only the last (cooling suppression) has any impact on the massive spheroidal component. In particular, a simulation with cooling suppression and feedback results in a rotation curve that, while still peaked, is considerably reduced from our standard runs.},

	abstract = {We utilize zoom-in cosmological simulations to study the nature of violent disc instability (VDI) in clumpy galaxies at high redshift, \$z=1\$--\$5\$. Our simulated galaxies are not in the ideal state assumed in Toomre instability, of linear fluctuations in an isolated, uniform, rotating disk. There, instability is characterised by a \$Q\$ parameter below unity, and lower when the disk is thick. Instead, the high-redshift discs are highly perturbed. Over long periods they consist of non-linear perturbations, compact massive clumps and extended structures, with new clumps forming in inter-clump regions. This is while the galaxy is subject to frequent external perturbances. We compute the local, two-component \$Q\$ parameter for gas and stars, smoothed on a \${\textbackslash}sim1{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm kpc\}\$ scale to capture clumps of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{8-9\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The \$Q{\textless}1\$ regions are confined to collapsed clumps due to the high surface density there, while the inter-clump regions show \$Q\$ significantly higher than unity. Tracing the clumps back to their relatively smooth Lagrangian patches, we find that \$Q\$ prior to clump formation typically ranges from unity to a few. This is unlike the expectations from standard Toomre instability. We discuss possible mechanisms for high-\$Q\$ clump formation, e.g. rapid turbulence decay leading to small clumps that grow by mergers, non-axisymmetric instability, or clump formation induced by non-linear perturbations in the disk. Alternatively, the high-\$Q\$ non-linear VDI may be stimulated by the external perturbations such as mergers and counter-rotating streams. The high \$Q\$ may represent excessive compressive modes of turbulence, possibly induced by tidal interactions.},

Molecular clouds are shaped into a complex filamentary structure by supersonic turbulence, with only a small fraction of the cloud mass channeled into collapsing protostars over a free-fall time of the system. In recent years, the physics of supersonic turbulence has been widely explored with computer simulations, leading to statistical models of this fragmentation process, and to the prediction of the star formation rate as a function of fundamental physical parameters of molecular clouds, such as the virial parameter, the rms Mach number, the compressive fraction of the turbulence driver, and the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure. Infrared space telescopes, as well as ground-based observatories have provided unprecedented probes of the filamentary structure of molecular clouds and the location of forming stars within them.},

	abstract = {Star formation in the Galactic disc is primarily controlled by gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. It is not clear that this also applies to star formation near the Galactic Centre. Here we determine the turbulence and star formation in the CMZ cloud G0.253+0.016. Using maps of 3mm dust emission and HNCO intensity-weighted velocity obtained with ALMA, we measure the volume-density variance \${\textbackslash}sigma\_\{{\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho\_0\} = 1.3 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5\$ and turbulent Mach number \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\} = 11 {\textbackslash}pm 3\$. Combining these with turbulence simulations to constrain the plasma \${\textbackslash}beta = 0.34 {\textbackslash}pm 0.35\$, we reconstruct the turbulence driving parameter \$b = 0.22 {\textbackslash}pm 0.12\$ in G0.253+0.016. This low value of \$b\$ indicates solenoidal (divergence-free) driving of the turbulence in G0.253+0.016. By contrast, typical clouds in the Milky Way disc and spiral arms have a significant compressive (curl-free) driving component (\$b {\textgreater} 0.4\$). We speculate that shear causes the solenoidal driving in G0.253+0.016 and show that this may reduce the star formation rate by a factor of 7 compared to nearby clouds.},

	abstract = {The role of disk instabilities, such as bars and spiral arms, and the associated resonances, in growing bulges in the inner regions of disk galaxies have long been studied in the low-redshift nearby Universe. There it has long been probed observationally, in particular through peanut-shaped bulges. This secular growth of bulges in modern disk galaxies is driven by weak, non-axisymmetric instabilities: it mostly produces pseudo-bulges at slow rates and with long star-formation timescales. Disk instabilities at high redshift (z{\textgreater}1) in moderate-mass to massive galaxies (10{\textasciicircum}10 to a few 10{\textasciicircum}11 Msun of stars) are very different from those found in modern spiral galaxies. High-redshift disks are globally unstable and fragment into giant clumps containing 10{\textasciicircum}8-10{\textasciicircum}9 Msun of gas and stars each, which results in highly irregular galaxy morphologies. The clumps and other features associated to the violent instability drive disk evolution and bulge growth through various mechanisms, on short timescales. The giant clumps can migrate inward and coalesce into the bulge in a few 10{\textasciicircum}8 yr. The instability in the very turbulent media drives intense gas inflows toward the bulge and nuclear region. Thick disks and supermassive black holes can grow concurrently as a result of the violent instability. This chapter reviews the properties of high-redshift disk instabilities, the evolution of giant clumps and other features associated to the instability, and the resulting growth of bulges and associated sub-galactic components.},
